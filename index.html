            <h2>About the Artist</h2>

            <p>
                Born on 26th July 1990 in Brajdham Hodal, Paras Khanna —
                fondly known as Paras Ladla — was drawn to devotion from the
                tender age of 9.
            </p>

            <p>
                Self-taught in dholak and bhajan singing, his journey unfolded
                through temples, kirtans, and quiet perseverance.
            </p>

            <p>
                A turning point came in Vrindavan, where saintly associations
                deepened his surrender to Thakurji.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today, he sings not for applause — but as Seva.

        <h3>The Journey</h3>

        Born on 26th July 1990 in Brajdham Hodal, the journey of Paras Khanna, now known as Paras Ladla, into devotion began at the tender age of 9. Drawn naturally towards temples and kirtans, he started playing the dholak and gradually found his voice in bhajan singing — purely self-taught, purely from the soul.
        A turning point came with visits to Vrindavan, where interactions with saints ignited a deeper spiritual awakening. From that moment, he dedicated his art to the service of Thakurji. Despite many struggles, God's grace always showed the way. Under the divine shelter of Pujya Baba Rasika Pagal Ji, life transformed, and for 10 years he humbly served his guru. In 2013, he took Diksha from Pujya Swami Dharam Dev Ji Maharaj, marking a deeper commitment to his spiritual path.
        His first devotional album “Badi Mehrbaani Hogi” was released with Sawariya Music, and since then, he has taken the road less traveled — performing in countless successful programs across India. From singing in jagrans at night to running a shop during the day to fund his education, his dedication reflects the true spirit of humility and hard work.
        There were times when even his own did not stand by him, but devotion never left his side. Through self-written and self-composed bhajans, he now aims to spread Sanatan Dharma, inspiring listeners to find peace and purpose through Radha Naam Jap.
        To him, music is Seva — serving not just through voice but through caring for monkeys, cows, and the needy. One of his most memorable milestones was the 2014 Kolkata event where Music Director R.D. Shekhawat publicly acknowledged him as an artist for the first time.
        In his heart, one simple feeling always echoes — “Saathi hamara kaun banega... Prabhu, tum na sunoge toh kaun sunega?”
        And that feeling… is what he sings.
